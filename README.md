Here’s a well-structured README for your Weather Forecast App, incorporating the backend code you provided:

Weather Forecast App 🌦️
A simple weather forecasting app that provides detailed weather data for a city over a selected number of days. It fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and visualizes it in an intuitive user interface using Streamlit and Plotly.

Features 🚀
City-Based Weather Data: Fetch weather forecasts for any city.
Custom Forecast Period: Choose the number of forecast days (1–5).
Dynamic Weather Parameters: Explore temperature, humidity, wind speed, sky conditions, and more.
Visualizations: Interactive graphs and charts for easy data interpretation.

Technologies Used 🛠️
Python Libraries:
Streamlit for creating the interactive UI.
Plotly for data visualization.
Requests for making API calls.
API: OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
Prerequisites 📋
Python: Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
API Key: Get an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
Dependencies: Install required Python libraries.
Installation 🛠️
Clone the Repository:

bash
Code kopieren
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecast-app.git  
cd weather-forecast-app  
Install Dependencies:

bash
Code kopieren
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Set API Key:

Create a .env file in the project root and add your API key:
makefile
Code kopieren
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  
Run the Application:

bash
Code kopieren
streamlit run app.py  
Access the App:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.

Usage 🚀
Enter City Name: Type the name of the city in the text input box.
Set Forecast Days: Use the slider to select the number of forecast days (1–5).
Choose Parameter: Pick a weather detail (e.g., Temperature, Humidity) from the dropdown menu.
Visualize Results: View interactive charts or images for the selected parameter.
Backend Logic 🧠
The backend (backend.py) is responsible for:

Fetching weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Filtering the forecast data based on the selected number of days.
Returning a cleaned list of weather details to the frontend for visualization.
Example Backend Code:
python
Code kopieren
from backend import get_data  

# Test the function  
city = "Darmstadt"  
forecast_days = 3  
print(get_data(city, forecast_days))  
Error Handling 🚧
If the API call fails or the city name is invalid, the app displays an error message:
"Invalid city name or data unavailable. Please try again."
